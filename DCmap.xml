    <dc:title>The Case of Charles Dexter Ward</dc:title>
    <dc:creator>Howard Phillips Lovecraft</dc:creator>
    <dc:subject>Horror Tales - American</dc:subject>
    <dc:description>Charles Ward, even as a child, had always wandered the streets of ancient Providence, drawn inexorably to its domes and spires, its hills and homes, its history and its haunts. His antiquarian habits were always just so: an innocent preoccupation with the city and its wonders. Yet, when the discovery of a shadowy ancestor exposes an eldritch malevolence long thought to be contained, Charles must resist the dark grip of his fascination, before it consumes him, and his world, completely.</dc:description>
