# Cthulhu-Mythos
### Final Project | LIS 2407 | University of Pittsburgh
<p>This github space contains metadata for a fifteen item collection inspired by the Cthulhu Mythos that was invented by HP Lovecraft and continues to be celebrated and expanded on by artists working in various mediums including board games, sketches, movies, literature, music and video games.</p>
<p>Documentation found in the Wiki is intended to explain what the collection is about; who potential users are; provide an application profile and explain the vocabularly and encoding schemes that render our data as valid XML files, including an explanation of our local Cthulhu Mythos collection vocabulary; and hypothetical functional requirements for searching the collection.</p>
